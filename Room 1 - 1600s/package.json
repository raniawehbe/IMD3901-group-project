  "description": "I created a Virtual reality environment with an antique theme in mind. What I was planning to do but could not do given the time constraints that I had is that I wanted \r to allow the user to play music and close the music everytime they press on the Gramophone. Also i wanted to allow them to pick up the magnifier and put it back along with \r zoom in on objects."
